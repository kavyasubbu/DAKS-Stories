### Tom: The Tenacious Cat

Tom is a sleek, gray-blue cat with piercing yellow eyes and a tail that flicks with anticipation. Though he lives a life of comfort, lounging in sunny spots or enjoying his meals, his primary goal is capturing Jerry. But what sets Tom apart isn't just his persistence—it's his creativity.

From elaborate traps involving pulleys and weights to disguises that fool everyone but Jerry, Tom’s determination knows no bounds. However, despite his best efforts, his plans almost always backfire hilariously, leaving him covered in soot, stuck in a tree, or outsmarted yet again.
